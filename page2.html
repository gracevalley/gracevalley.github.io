                    <p class="card-text">The campus is located at Maravattam, near Kadampuzha, Malappuram District in 3 acres of lush and lavish greenery. The landscape is comprised of enchanting hills and shade trees that make the campus a feast for the eyes. The architecture of the school is doe in such a way that it is able to receive the fresh air and cool of the lush trees to all the class rooms.
<br>We understand the importance of a classroom in a student’s life. The class rooms at GVPS help to create inviting and nurturing learning environment. It is not what is included in the four walls what we expect, but what all things possible to be done by students being in the safety of four walls.&nbsp;<br><strong>Transportation 
</strong><br>We founded GVPS in a remote area so as to get the real ambience of a campus and to have the full freedom to enjoy the earth at its fullest; pure air and the scenic beauty of mountains and trees. 
<br>The need for safe passage of each student to school and back home is of paramount importance to us. To ensure safe travel the school has its own fleet of buses and cruisers designed as per standards and manned by trained drivers and personnel sensitized to the needs of small children. A transport attendant is on board throughout the journey for supervision and monitoring.&nbsp;<br></p>

<br><strong>Teaching Methodology
</strong><br>The teaching is meant here in GVPS  the effort for the enhancement of Knowledge, propagation of truth and multi faceted development. The methodology that school follows for the teaching is: Authentic, Interactive, Learner Centered, Continuous, Process Focused and Integrated.
<br><strong>Core Philosophy
</strong><br>We strictly believe that every child is unique, physically, mentally and intellectually. Each one has different faces of learning that are to be discovered and understood by both the parents and school. We try to mould the character of the learners, empower them in all aspects – physically, mentally, emotionally, intellectually and socially.
<br><strong>Academic Faculty
</strong><br>The grace family has nearly 70 committed and qualified teaching staff for both materialistic education and spiritual education whose passion for excellence is apparent in their domains. Their vast experience combined with the constant training offered to them by the Management, our Training Partners and by the Book Publishing Agents results in lessons being taught in class rooms differently, students being encouraged to come up with creative responses, and showing that learning is fun and interactive.
<br>Outside the classroom our teachers act as counselors to students, like a friend, often helping them deal with ‘growing up’ issues, further strengthening the bond between our students and the faculty. And this special relationship translates into ‘The Grace family’ becoming a happy centre of learning.
